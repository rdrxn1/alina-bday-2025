## My forever spring

I fell for you under the soft glow of a lavender sky, and every day since has felt like another petal unfurling. Thank you for your laughter, the quiet ways you care, and the courage you teach me.

- I love the way your eyes light up when you spot fresh flowers.
- I love how you turn rainy days into little adventures.
- I love that you feel like home, no matter where we are.

Here’s to the dreams we still get to plant, the journeys we still get to take, and the mornings I wake up grateful that it’s you beside me.

**Happy 25th Birthday, Alina. My forever, my always.**
